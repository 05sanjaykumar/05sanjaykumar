# Sanjay Kumar - 0 -> 1 MVP  & Product Builder

**Shipping AI-powered products that solve real business problems.**

I am techincal generalist and solution architect who can build just an idea into a working SaaS without hand holding. Just give me idea or say your problem I will give custom solution, no need hanlding holding. 

## Technical Foundation

**Fun fact:** I can learn anything at that time and give  custom solution, I learn quickly and produce immediate value unlike being bound by any technology. I don't just give advice, I just show working results with implementation. I am never limited by any technology since I focus more on logic and working flow. I have other skills including game dev, etc. But yeah I haven't included and did have place to include and mostly forget my own skills that I have ðŸ˜….
