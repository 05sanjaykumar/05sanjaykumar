### Hi there 👋

**My Past Journey:**
- 🚀 College Undergrad who loves to code, My Journey started from class 6th.

Also I know to use game basics of game engines like Unity, Unreal engine. Make car Games using Unity. I have used Kali linux, I know basic terminal commands of linux.
- 🎇 I am working on Youtube From my 6th Grade, I know Basic editing skills, I was a gamer before. Video Editing skills I have used Vegas Pro 13, photoshot, etc.
- 📖 On 8th grade, I have learned about Science and techonogies. I have read books like general theory of relativity by sean caroles, Leaned fundaments of quantum mechanics like quantum entanglement, superposition.
- 🧑‍🏫 On 4th Grade, I used to watch channels on TV like "cosmos", "Through the worm hole by morgan freeman", "Trust me I a doctor",etc. I am really curious science kid. My first Dream was to became a scientist. But after using computer my goal shifted towards coding.
- 🙇🏻 11th and 12th went in Jee, secured 92%ile in jee, no coaching, no drop, no guidance, fully done through my searching knowledge using google for materials and other things. I have learned how to use stratergy, I now was able to understand why to learn everything from basics, I always to understand what do we require( always the end goal). We must understand our end goal and we should analyse different source available. I understood the patterns behind JEE, not to study all the chapters, to analyze what are required overall, to always spend time to gather information before getting started. To not to overdo things. These are the things that I have learned from my Jee journey.
