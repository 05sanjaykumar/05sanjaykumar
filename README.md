# Sanjay Kumar - Technical Founder & Product Builder

**Shipping AI-powered products that solve real business problems.**

Currently scaling an AI email management platform helping customer support teams cut response times by 70%.

## What I'm Building

ðŸš€ **Founder and CEO of Skyler AI** - SaaS tool that transforms Social Media into an intelligent customer service hub. Uses sentiment analysis to automatically prioritize frustrated customers and enables bulk responses.

**Early traction:** Solving email chaos for growing support teams at 20+ companies.

**Vision:** Expanding to complete social media management suite for business communications and Virtual Reality. 

## Founder Collaboration

I partner with non-technical founders who have validated business ideas but need someone to build and ship the actual product. Think of me as your technical co-founder on specific projects.

**What I Bring:**
- Full product development from idea to paying customers
- AI/ML integration expertise for competitive advantage  
- Rapid shipping mindset - MVP to market in 3-4 weeks
- Business understanding of SaaS metrics and growth

**Ideal Partnerships:**
- You have market insights, I handle all technical execution
- Revenue-sharing or equity partnerships for the right opportunities
- Focus on B2B SaaS where technical differentiation matters
- Building to solve real problems, not just cool demos

## Current Tech Focus

**AI-First Products:** LLM integrations, automation, intelligent data processing
**B2B SaaS Infrastructure:** Multi-tenant architecture, usage-based billing, analytics
**Browser Extensions:** Chrome/Gmail integrations for productivity tools
**API-First Development:** Building for scale and third-party integrations

## Technical Foundation

**Full-Stack:** React/Next.js, Node.js, Python, PostgreSQL
**AI/ML:** OpenAI, LangChain, Groq, custom model fine-tuning  
**Infrastructure:** Docker, VPS, automated deployments
**SaaS Essentials:** Stripe, auth systems, usage tracking, webhooks

## Open Source Contributions

I maintain several production-ready frameworks that founders use to ship faster:

- **SaaS Architecture Template** - Complete multi-tenant setup
- **AI Integration Boilerplate** - LLM chat interfaces and automation
- **Gmail Extension Framework** - Email productivity tool foundation
- **Payment & Analytics Stack** - Stripe + usage tracking + dashboards

## Let's Build Something

**Looking for founders who:**
- Have identified real market problems (not just "cool ideas")
- Want to move fast and validate with actual customers
- Need technical execution but want to stay involved in product decisions
- Are building for B2B markets where AI can create real competitive advantages

**Not interested in:**
- Pure consulting or "build this exact spec" projects
- Consumer apps without clear monetization
- Projects where I'm just an implementer, not a partner

**Reach out if:** You're a founder with a validated problem and want a technical partner who thinks like a CEO, not just a developer.
